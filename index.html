                </h1>
                <p>
                    The solar system has one star, eight planets, five officially recognized dwarf planets, at least 290
                    moons, more than
                    1.3 million asteroids, and about 3,900 comets.
                    It is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur.
                    Our solar system
                    orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years
                    to complete one
                    orbit around the galactic center.
                    We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it
                    by gravity – the
                    planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto,
                    Ceres, Makemake, Haumea,
                    and Eris – along with hundreds of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.
